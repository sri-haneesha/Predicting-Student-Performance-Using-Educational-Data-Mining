# Predicting-Student-Performance-Using-Educational-Data-Mining
This project leverages educational data mining techniques to predict student academic performance and identify key learning behavior patterns. Using machine learning algorithms, the study provides actionable insights for improving student engagement and outcomes.

**Dataset**
Source: [Kalboard 360 xAPI Edu Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data)
Records: 480 students
Features: 16 attributes including gender, nationality, grade level, participation, resource usage, absenteeism, and parental engagement
Target: Student performance classified into Low, Medium, High levels

**Methodology**
Tools: WEKA 3.8.4
Algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, J48, Multilayer Perceptron
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure, Confusion Matrix

**Key Findings**
Multilayer Perceptron achieved the highest accuracy of 77.3%.
Engagement metrics (raised hands, resource visits, discussion participation) and parental involvement are strong predictors of student performance.
The results can guide personalized learning strategies and targeted academic interventions.

**Future Scope**
Integrate clustering techniques for faster and more accurate predictions.
Develop adaptive learning systems based on predictive insights.
